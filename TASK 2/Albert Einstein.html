      </p>
      
      <p>
        Einstein is best known for his formula <em>E = mcÂ²</em>, which describes the equivalence of energy (E) and mass (m) and has become synonymous with his name.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        His contributions to physics revolutionized our understanding of the universe, space, and time. Einstein's theories laid the foundation for many scientific advancements and continue to inspire and challenge scientists to this day.
